## My process
I have used mobile-first approach,therefore styling was first written for mobile screens and later for desktop with media queries.
In CSS, I defined custom CSS properties and redefined them in media queries when any change was required in different screen sizes. I used CSS Reset (code taken from https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) to remove any discrepencies for browser default properties. I have used BEM naming convention.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Reset
- BEM
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned some best practices when writing this project. It includes having one h1 tag and one main tag in page.
